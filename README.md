# GoSwipe - what movie to watch next
### Introduction
GoSwipe is the movie-searching app for yourself and others on a movie night. Developed for the Research and Development course of Computing Science at the Radboud University.

Please note that this app is not ready for release and still has some critical bugs. It is mostly functional but can experience issues when e.g. "swiping" movies too fast. This project is not being worked on anymore and is not expected to be improved in the future.

### Built using
The application's main components are the The Movie Database API,  websockets and UI implementation in Java.

### Final notes
This was made for a 1st year CS course "Research and Development" at Radboud University in 2021. It contains some obviously incorrect code for this reason.
